# List of Bazel patches

* `databinding-caching.patch` - Fixes layout-info.zip being non deterministic due to timestamp.
* `disable-resource-conflitcs.patch` - Large no of resource conflicts can spam logs with `CONFLICT` messages. This patch disables that.
* https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/11253 - Add flag to disable output library.ap_ and reduce output size.
